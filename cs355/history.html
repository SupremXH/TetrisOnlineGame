<p><center><p style="color:white">In 1979, Alexey Pajitnov joined the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences as a speech recognition researcher. When he was responsible for testing the function of the new hardware, his ambition was to use computers to make people happy. Pajitnov developed several puzzle games on the computer of the institute, namely Electronika 60, which was a scarce resource at the time. For Pajitnov, "Games allow people to understand each other better and act as a revealer of things that people would not normally notice."

In 1984, while trying to remake his favorite puzzle game featuring pentose from childhood, Pajitnov thought of a game that consisted of randomly dropped parts that players could fill in rows. Pajitnov believed that the game would become unnecessarily complicated due to changes in twelve different shapes, so he narrowed the concept to four elements, including seven variants. Pajitnov named the game "Tetris", a word composed of "tetromino" and his favorite sport "tennis". Because Electronika 60 does not have a graphical interface, Pajitnov uses spaces and parentheses to model fields and fragments. Realizing that the completed lines quickly filled the screen, Pajitnov decided to delete them, thus creating a key part of the Tetris game. This early version of Tetris had no scoring system and no levels, but its addictive quality distinguished it from other puzzle games created by Pajitnov.

Paginov introduced Tetris to his colleagues, and soon they became hooked. It penetrated into the office of the Academy of Sciences and reached every institute in Moscow by computer within a few weeks. Vladimir Pokhilko, a friend of Paginov, asked the Moscow Medical Institute for a match. He saw people stop playing Tetris. Pokhilko eventually banned the game from the Institute of Medicine to restore productivity.

Packetnov strives to adapt Tetris to the IBM personal computer, which has a higher quality display than Electronika 60 Packitnov recruited Vadim Grasimov, a 16-year-old high school student who is his Computer skills are famous. Paginov knew Glasimov before he met. They had been working together in previous games. Gerasimov adapted Tetris to the IBM PC in a few weeks, and added color and scoreboard.</center></p>
