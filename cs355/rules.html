<h2> <center><p style="color:white">you can only move the pieces in specific ways  </center></h2>
<h2> <center><p style="color:white">your game is over if your pieces reach the top of the screen</center> </h2>

<p><center><p style="color:white">Tetris is mainly composed of a game field in which fragments of different geometric shapes drop from the top of the field. During the descent, players can move the pieces horizontally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on the previously placed pieces. The player can neither slow down the debris nor stop them. The goal of the game is to use chess pieces to create as many horizontal block lines as possible. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the square placed above drops by one level. Points will be awarded for completing the line, and accumulating a certain number of points will raise the player to a level, which will increase the points awarded for each complete line. The speed of falling blocks increases as each level increases, allowing players less time to consider placement. Players can clear multiple lines at once and earn points. Up to 4 production lines can be completed simultaneously using l-shaped tetranectin; if the player cannot make the square disappear fast enough, the area will begin to fill, and when the pieces reach the top of the area and prevent other pieces from reaching, the game ends. At the end of each game, players will receive points based on the number of completed lines.</center></p>
